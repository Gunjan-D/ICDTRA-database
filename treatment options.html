              <p>High radiation doses are used during radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy,
                 to eradicate cancer cells and reduce tumour size. When taking x-rays of your teeth 
                 or broken bones, for example, low doses of radiation are used to see inside your body.
                Radiation therapy damages cancer cells' DNA, which kills or stunts the growth of cancer
                 cells at high doses.

              <p>Your immune system is assisted in fighting cancer by immunotherapy, a type of cancer treatment. Your body's 
                immune system aids in the defence against infections and other diseases. White blood cells, organs, and lymphatic system tissues make up its composition.

                Biological therapy includes immunotherapy. A type of treatment called biological therapy uses components 
                derived from living organisms to combat cancer.

              <p>Surgery is a procedure in which a surgeon removes cancer from your body to treat cancer. 
                Doctors who specialise in surgery are known as surgeons.
                During surgery, surgeons frequently cut your body with scalpels, which are tiny, thin knives. 
                Cuttings through skin, muscles, and occasionally bone are common during surgery.

              <p>A form of cancer treatment known as targeted therapy targets specific proteins that regulate the growth,
                 division, and spread of cancer cells. Precision medicine is built on this. As scientists gain more knowledge 
                 about the DNA alterations and proteins that fuel cancer, they are better able to develop therapies that 
                 specifically target these proteins.

              <p>A type of cancer treatment known as hormone therapy involves the removal, blocking, or addition
                 of particular hormones to the body. It is also known as endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy, or 
                 anti-hormonal therapy.

                The growth of some cancers is fueled by the body's own hormones. It's crucial to understand that 
                hormone therapy used to treat cancer is different from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or menopausal
                 hormone therapy (MHT).

              <p>Chemotherapy (also called chemo) is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. 
                In addition to killing rapidly dividing healthy cells, chemotherapy also kills rapidly dividing cancer 
                cells. Examples include the cells that line your mouth, intestines, and those that stimulate the growth 
                of your hair. It's possible for side effects like mouth sores, nausea, and hair loss to result from harm
                 to healthy cells.

              <p>Certain cancers can be treated with a stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant. 
                Depending on where the stem cells are obtained, this procedure may be referred to as a cord blood 
                transplant or a peripheral stem cell transplant. 
                Hematopoietic stem cells are young (immature) cells that give rise to all blood cells in your body, 
                including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.
