            The Eph-Ephrin protein family plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, tissue patterning, and neuronal development. 
              Here is a brief overview of the background, history, and discovery of the Eph-Ephrin protein: <br>
        </br>

               Background:<br>
      </br>
              The Eph-Ephrin protein family is a group of cell surface receptors and their ligands involved in cell-cell communication.
               These proteins mediate bidirectional signaling through interactions between Eph receptors (tyrosine kinases) and Ephrin 
               ligands (membrane-bound proteins). 
              This interaction triggers diverse cellular responses, such as repulsion or attraction, leading to the regulation of cell 
                adhesion, migration, and tissue boundary formation.
              </br>

              <br>History and Discovery:<br>
     </br>

            1. Early Observations: <br><br>The initial observations related to Eph-Ephrin proteins can be traced back to the 1980s and 1990s 
              when researchers noticed their role in axon guidance during neuronal development.
              Eph-Ephrin interactions were found to be crucial for the formation of topographic maps in the visual system and the
               guidance of axons along specific pathways.</br>

               2.Eph Receptor Cloning:
               <br>

              <br>In the early 1990s, the first Eph receptor, EphA1, was cloned by Pasquale and colleagues. 
                This discovery paved the way for further exploration of the Eph-Ephrin family.Subsequently, the cloning of other Eph receptors, including EphB1, 
                EphB2, EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, etc., followed.

                <br>3.Ephrin Ligand Discovery:
                <br>
 
               <br>

               Concurrently, researchers identified membrane-bound ligands that interact with Eph receptors, which were named Ephrins.
               Ephrins were classified into two major subclasses: 
               Ephrin-A and Ephrin-B, based on their structural and functional characteristics.
